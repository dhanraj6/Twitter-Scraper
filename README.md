Scraping twitter data and hashtag frequency using Tweepy

### Scraping With Tweepy

Tweepy requires Twitter developer credentials. 

In order to receive credentials, you must apply to become a Twitter developer [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en). This does require that you have a Twitter account. The application will ask various questions about what sort of work you want to do. Donâ€™t worry, the process is relatively easy.

Get api related keys like consumerKey, consumerSecret, accessToken, accessTokenSecret from your account and enter it in above .py file and run the file.
